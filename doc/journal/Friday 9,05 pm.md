Finally I can get around to starting Ludum Dare after setting up my repository and such. 
Surprisingly the only thing that went wrong was my website because something went wrong with ruby (I use github pages).
Good thing I worked it out now when I wouldn't be rushed. Also, I updated jekyll from 2 to 3, so I get incremental builds.
Now I have to take a show and think about what I'm going to do.
