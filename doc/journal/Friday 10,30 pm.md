I really had trouble coming up with ideas. I had trouble filling up one page with ideas. 
I listened the yogscast's *Get F'd Up* song and *Population: US* album for some inspiration, which did not help.
I came across multiple good ideas like
having a computer terminal and having an assistant talk to people and use a computer to uncover his boss's shady activity.
I settled on the idea of an elevator operator overhearing conversations. Since the story is important, I have to figure that out.
The story has to take place in the time of elevator operations. After looking it up it is ... still today in some places.
The story can take place anywhere between 1870 and 1930 because it's after the invention of the elevator and before the Great Depression.
I'm probably going to do this during the 20s since there is the entire bootlegging and bond thing that I know something about.
