Sbl took a while to code and there's still a bug with line numbers and there's no function support.
Sbl was completely unnecessary, but it was still fun. Best LD so far. (not game wise though).
Tomorrow I have a lot to do like programming the levels, gui, art, sound, music and most importantly the storyline.
I'm probably not going to get to it all, but I hope I can work on this over winter break.
I might port sbl to c because it may have some other uses beyond this game.
Anyway, I'm going to bed now.
