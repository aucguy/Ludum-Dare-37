For this LD, I'm way behind, but I'm feeling good. This is probably because I haven't spent that much time coding.
I've just been trying to figure out the storyline. As the storyline goes on this should become easier.
Regardless of what happens I should get a programming language out of this, which is a feat in itself.
Writing the storyline should be easier as it goes on.
